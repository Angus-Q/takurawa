# Tāku Rawa | Personal Accounting Software
Tāku Rawa, translating directly to 'My Wealth', is a personal accounting software designed to improve how individuals track income and expenses, therefore improving the financial wellbeing of the individual.

# Mission
To create a free, easy-to-use accounting software for individuals to track and monitor income, expenses, and spending habits.

# Project Timeline
## October 2025 to March 2026
I anticipate submitting a demo version of this project to the Swift Student Challenge in 2026 (SSC26), and to conform to the rule about being a solo developer, I will not accept contributions towards this public project until after the submission deadline. The purpose of keeping this project public is to make it accessible to users who want to trial the software themselves, or learn about the Swift code behind the program.

By the end of February (for the SSC26 submission deadline), my goal is to have a simple working version of the application that can provide me with various financial insights to improve how I track and manage my income and expenses.

These program features will include:

+ A month-by-month overview of income and expenses
+ Visual representations of true expenditure against predicted or budgeted expenditure
+ Budgeting capabilities for each new month
+ Transaction monitoring and categorising

## April 2026 to August 2026
